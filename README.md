## Classification

Algorithms considered:

* Random Forrest
* **k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Classifier

Algorithm selection:

* Balancing data with SMOTE+Tomek (reduce recall, increase precision)
* Manual Cross Validation parameter tuning
* Out-of-sample accuracy comparision of various algorithms
* **k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier with `n_neighbors=2`**

Expected value of **`balanced accuracy`: 88%**
